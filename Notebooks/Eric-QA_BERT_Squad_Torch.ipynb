immensely proud to present the th Edition of the Quirk marketing textbook e It is now years since we began work on the first edition and it s quite amazing c a to see how much it has grown Not only in line with the changes in our industry f but also through very important input from our passionate and kind community of e r learners and educators P The evolution of the discipline of marketing is best represented by the change in i the subtitle of our book When we started this book was called eMarketing the essential guide to digital marketing Today as you will see we have adjusted this to eMarketing the essential guide to marketing in a digital world This change has been an easy and natural one It underlines an important shift in the way we think about and engage with digital Digital is not a channel in the same way that a marketer might view television or radio as a channel Instead digital is a way of life It is the experiential glue which binds previously separated media together Because of this digital enables a cohesive brand experience that wasn t previously on offer In fact it s highly likely that within the next edition or two we will need to acknowledge this shift in the role of digital by ditching the e in eMarketing At best it is quickly becoming pass at worst it will become completely redundant At Quirk we no longer see ourselves as a digital marketing agency but rather as a marketing agency born digital We still consider ourselves to be experts in the digital realm and as digital natives we still have bits and bytes coursing through our veins However it is because of our understanding of brands and how to build them in a digital world that our clients are turning to us for far more than just a website or some SEO Today we find ourselves as lead agency on a number of prestigious brands These brands see that their customers are living in a digital world and therefore trust a partner like Quirk to lead them in that world Our textbook is now used in almost academic institutions globally This is largely due to brave and forward thinking educators to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude They have walked a journey with us embraced a book published by an agency a fact which hasn t gained easy acceptance by the very traditional academic community and have provided us with tremendous encouragement and invaluable feedback to ensure that this book keeps pace not only with a fast moving industry but with their evolving needs as well We believe in education Educated people make better decisions and have more potential for an improved life We also believe that particularly for tertiary education to have an effective future a partnership between the private and academic sectors is vital It ensures the very best education is as accessible as it can be to as many people as possible By making our textbook available for free online we hope to propel this dream forward In fact less than of the many institutions who use our book actually pay for it and we are thrilled by this At Quirk we want to make a dent in the world and this is an important part of us achieving that Another important change for this edition has been the appointment of our I started Quirk almost years ago Whilst we ve grown successfully as a business academic partner Red Yellow who have helped us improve the pedagogy and over that time this textbook remains my proudest achievement even though I didn t academic rigour of the textbook Founded twenty years ago in Red Yellow write it I may have had the original idea but it s a team effort and I wouldn t want is one of South Africa s leading marketing colleges Last year Quirk Education to take that away from the people who have worked so hard to make it a reality merged with Red Yellow to form an academic institution which we believe Putting each edition together takes a huge amount of work by many people My will serve its students very well into the future This new entity combines Red name is on the front purely because someone s name has to be on the front Yellow s tremendous experience in marketing s academic space with Quirk s Thankfully the font gets smaller and smaller every year digital skills and online training expertise Relevant and practical content can thus be delivered through the methodology best suited for the student online In particular I want to recognise Kat Scholtz who has overseen the production of contact or a hybrid of both In order to effectively join forces we must see the end this th Edition I have worked with Kat for over years now and you just couldn t of the Quirk Education brand This is slightly sad for me but is part of an important find a better qualified person to lead such an effort I mean this both from a skills evolution and I am immensely excited about the high quality of students Red and experience perspective as well as the deep passion and excitement Kat has for Yellow is already producing at this early stage of their combined adventure The producing a great resource which we know will help many hundreds of thousands future holds great promise indeed of people Kat has also surrounded herself with a phenomenal knowledge team whose job it has been to synthesize the knowledge of our agency into an easy to From a content perspective this book is a real step up from the previous edition As use guide which is accessible to all To Kat and her team from the bottom of my with the th Edition we ve maintained Quirk s Think Create Engage and Optimise heart I thank you so very much for your incredibly hard work in making this dream structure We have however worked much harder to acknowledge the useful a reality You deserve all the credit for this fantastic book links between disciplines throughout the book The lines between disciplines in the media landscape can be blurry but we find the TCEO structure gives us I m proud of the book because it genuinely is good and it is genuinely free To an effective way of tackling the big picture explanation for comprehension This have brought Quirk to a place where it can afford to make this contribution to our foundation then enables us to focus on the nuance where the rubber hits the road industry and community is an incredible feeling Apart from a general update of facts stats and case studies we ve made a few We hope you enjoy our book and remember the most important thing any human other important changes Firstly the Think section has been expanded with a can do is teach even if you re not a teacher Share your knowledge and make the much improved market research chapter and the addition of content strategy world a better place chapter as well The section is better equipped as a platform for approaching the rest of the book and the marketing process in general In the Create section Onwards and upwards we ve added a chapter on User experience design and in the Engage section the Video Marketing and Mobile chapters have been greatly expanded to reflect their Rob growing importance in the marketing landscape The last update is a valuable one for readers of the printed edition Because the book is available for free download we wanted to give you extra reason to part with your hard earned cash when buying a printed copy To achieve this we ve partnered with many great vendors to provide a wide array of useful vouchers that will help you get started with what you learn from this book vi vii Some thoughts on Marketing from Seth Godin n i d I don t think you ll learn much from this textbook It s nothing specific I actually

Wishing you digital success The QuirkStars Situating digital in marketing Situating digital in marketing Introduction Situating digital in marketing Understanding digital marketing Introduction Understanding digital marketing Today no marketing strategy is complete if it does not incorporate digital strategy How does digital marketing fit into this definition There is in fact no basic and expression Understanding digital requires thinking beyond any one tool or difference between traditional marketing and digital marketing They are one channel and towards an exchange of value an economic system trading with and the same attention as currency Ultimately the aim of any type of marketing is to keep customers and stimulate sales in the future Digital communication tools make it possible to connect and What is digital Bud Caddell defines digital as a participatory layer of all media build long term relationships with customers that allows users to self select their own experiences and affords marketers the ability to bridge media gain feedback iterate their message and collect Digital marketing helps to create consumer demand by using the power of the relationships Caddell In other words digital is a new way of exploring interconnected interactive web It enables the exchange of currency but more content for users and connecting with customers for marketers than that it enables the exchange of attention for value This is referred to as the attention economy Digital is not just a set of marketing channels it s a different way of thinking about how people engage with media each other and the world around them Digital Digital marketing is powerful in two fundamental ways First the audience can be enables you to segment your audience and customise messages in a valuable and segmented very precisely even down to factors like current location and recent measurable way The availability of information our inherent desire to contribute brand interactions which means that messages can and must be personalised and user friendly technology have rewritten the rules of engagement People and tailored specially for them are not passive consumers

how to get the most out of this textbook Crowdsourcing is a powerful example of the way digital tools have enabled certain ways of thinking In simple terms crowdsourcing is a distributed problem solving and production model that relies on an active community Understanding marketing to find solutions to problems Crowdsourcing relies heavily on the tools and communication forms made possible by the Internet Before we can delve into digital marketing it s important to understand the Given that the Internet connects people all over the world through different fundamentals that underpin marketing itself After all digital marketing has the publishing tools and technologies the information and ideas on these channels same purpose intentions and objectives have become commodities in themselves In the past we had to gather physically Dr Philip Kotler defines marketing as follows Marketing is that function of the to create crowds Now with technology crowds can be closely connected while organisation that can keep in constant touch with the organisation s consumers being geographically distant read their needs develop products that meet these needs and build a programme By listening to the crowd and asking for their contributions organisations of communications to express the organisation s purposes can gain first hand insight into their customers needs and desires and build Kotler and Levy p products and services that meet those needs and desires With an earned sense of ownership communities may feel a brand building kinship with the community through collaboration and contribution Situating digital in marketing Understanding digital marketing Situating digital in marketing Understanding digital marketing Using the Internet a savvy organisation can tap a wider range of talent and knowledge than is contained in its own resources Tapping into this resource can be done in one of three ways Crowdsourcing which involves asking and enabling people to share their ideas or creations in exchange for an emotional or monetary reward This is the most common type used for marketing and idea generation Websites such as Threadless Idea Bounty and Wikipedia en wikipedia org are prime examples of crowdsourcing Crowdfunding which involves asking many people in a large crowd each to donate a small amount of money in order to gather a large sum to fund a specific project or venture Kickstarter is a well known platform where people who want to start projects can ask for backers to fund them The higher the contribution the more the backer will receive once the project is complete Figure The ways in which people use digital media Source InMobi Microtasking which involves breaking a big task or project down into tiny components and asking many people to each complete a few of these The key to succeeding is two fold ideas must be remarkable and you must find a components usually for payment One company that uses microtasking niche group who are obsessed with your product and willing to devote their scant is BrandsEye which pays members of its crowd to attention to it These fans may tell their friends and in doing so spread the word evaluate the sentiment behind mentions in social media over their interconnected digital networks If most consumers are likely to ignore your marketing message then the goal is to speak to those who are actually listening Communities that use crowdsourcing platforms exist for different reasons Some exist because there are people who have a keen interest in and affinity for This leads to another key digital consideration These days people themselves are those brands They participate in the community because they want to improve media channels After all most of us create share comment on and link to content the products and services they receive Others want to gain a monetary reward that we find interesting or that we think will interest our friends and followers or the prestige of devising the winning solution These personalised digital broadcasts are intercepted by people who are interested in what we are saying and have chosen to listen to us Through this individuals have Whatever the case crowdsourcing demonstrates the power of the Internet it become conduits for information ideas and news in a powerful way connects people builds communities spreads messages and taps into a global source of ideas and inspiration Digital audiences Both the media landscape and people s media habits have changed There are many fragmented and highly specific niche communities at play across multiple digital media channels At the same time people s attention is fragmented by the many new media channels and tools available on top of traditional media we now have social networks emails web

media personalities and fragmented attention spans tie in to the ability to segment online audiences and The benefit for marketers should be clear While traditional media are undoubtedly customise messages effective it s sometimes hard to know exactly what is working how well it s working and why Digital can help you pinpoint the success of campaigns down to Segmentation is the process of

wanted they would have said faster horses While this may seem like the most obvious point it s surprising how often the Usability and conventions user is forgotten in the user experience Business owners marketers and web developers frequently focus on creating the web platforms they want and think are Usability is about making the digital assets we build easy and intuitive to use To best instead of really interrogating what the user needs Often the performance paraphrase Steve Krug don t make your users think they should just do Krug of web assets is compromised when the design process is driven only by internal business needs for instance ensuring that each department in the company has a space that it controls on the home page at the expense of what the user needs One of the most important aspects of usability involves sticking to standard conventions which are simply common rules or ways of displaying or structuring When designing for the user you need to ask the following questions things on the web Popular conventions include Who is the user Links that are blue and underlined What are the user s wants and needs from your platform Navigation menus at the top or left of the web page Why is the user really coming to your website The logo in the top left hand corner which is linked to take the user back NOTE What are the user s capabilities web skills and available technology to the home page Can you think of any other web conventions What features would make the user s experience easier and better Search boxes placed at the top of the page using standard wording such How have these evolved as search or a magnifying glass icon over time and how important is it to stick to the rules The answers to these questions will come out of user research

viewing it from a mobile device or a desktop computer and then Mobile devices adapt the layout and material to that device The thread uniting these One of the biggest challenges to mobile UX and indeed any venture involving different approaches is a desire to place the mobile is the sheer number of different device categories and models available user s needs at the one estimate puts the number of mobile phone handset models at over centre of the design running over distinct operating systems CEM Mobile Broadly speaking there are five main categories that mobile devices can fall into

somehow from the background and from static elements One approach is to make the button look like a real button standing out from its environment Calls to Action Another train of thought advocates for the flat design approach as a more elegant and modern expression of this Successful CTAs are simple quick clear actions that don t require the user to do anything scary or make a commitment They should always do exactly what they state to instil confidence and clarity It s all about managing the user s expectations do they actually go where they think they will or perform the action they expect Figure Clickable CTA buttons Positioning The primary CTA should usually appear above the fold to capture the attention focused here Other CTAs can appear below the fold and the main CTA can

Forms are extremely useful tools for gathering user information and encouraging interaction on the site Users are generally familiar with them and have some experience filling them out and there are lots of web conventions that govern how these should be set up As a general rule the shorter you can make your form the better The fewer fields a user has to fill out the more likely they are to complete the process Steps and sections Simple forms with only a few fields can be assembled as a series of boxes For forms that are longer for example those in eCommerce checkouts or complex registration processes it makes sense to split them up into manageable portions and manage a user s expectations by clearly indicating what the next step is Figure The Kalahari com checkout process clearly indicates the steps and Figure A simple form that provides assistance to users Source Basecamp forms that the user must complete Relevance Validation NOTE Simplicity is a key consideration forms should be as short and clear as possible Validation means giving the user feedback on the inputs they have submitted Be aware of local The effort must be equal to the reward gained All of the fields included must be whether correct or incorrect Validation can happen at two points after the user laws that define what clearly relevant to the purpose of the form otherwise the user may get confused information you re has submitted the form or during the process of filling out the form The latter or suspect that you are harvesting their information allowed to collect and called live inline validation usually results in a much better user experience as how you can use it the users know that their information is correct before submitting the form Assistance It is a good idea to include help for users filling out forms This is especially the case where a specific field requires inputs to be entered in a certain way and doubly so for password fields with special rules Users will not instinctively know the rules associated with specific fields so you must give plenty of guidance along the way Figure Twitter has a simple intuitive sign up form that provides clear guidance

User testing means giving one or more users access to a website or prototype and observing how they behave when using it The purpose of this is to discover What facilities are available problems and gain insights that can be used to improve the final product How many participants do I want to test The goal of user testing is not to eliminate each and every potential problem on a At what stage is the project website that s simply not possible especially if you consider how subjective this can be The goal is to work towards creating the best possible experience for the user by constantly improving and optimising User testing methodologies There are many ways to conduct UX user testing Here are a few options to get The two biggest questions around testing tend to be What do I test and When do you started I test it The answers are simple test as much as possible as often as possible NOTE and as early as possible Of course in the real Hallway testing world time and budget limitations will certainly Hallway testing is the name given to quick informal tests conducted in the have an impact on how office they often literally involve stopping someone in the hallway and asking much you can test but them to take part in a quick test your goal should always Create new be to maximise testing in whichever way you can version This is a great way to perform broad rough testing to help spot any glaring errors that the UX team haven t seen Observation and user labs Identify Test Generally the purpose of an observational study in a user lab is to get a holistic improvements overview of how the user responds to the website and to spot any major issues Looking at the user s body language and facial expressions can help to reveal how they feel about the experience itself while looking at how they work through the tasks assigned to them shows the usability and intuitiveness of the website Analyse results User labs tend to involve one participant at a time being tested and observed by one or more researchers Specialised testing labs have features such as one way mirrors and video feeds to facilitate this but you could easily set up a webcam streaming to a computer outside the room to simulate the same effect Figure Iterative UX testing process User Experience Design Step by step guide to UX design User Experience Design Step by step guide to UX design NOTE Split testing and multivariate testing choose will depend largely on your budget and timeline as well as on how many A split test also called an A B test involves creating two distinct versions of participants you want to recruit Read more about this in the Conversion the same web page usually with one specific element changed for example a Optimisation chapter Once you get enough responses you will have the chance to screen applicants different image or CTA The versions are served to separate groups of users Screening is the process of filtering people into those who are suitable for the test and the tester then analyses which page is more effective and those who are not because they do not meet certain criteria A multivariate test functions in the same way except that several different Test elements on the page are changed at the same time showing which combination of elements works best The chapter on Conversion Optimisation explains these At this point you are ready to begin testing Tell the user what you want them to do in more detail and let the test run Don t interfere Eye tracking Analyse Eye tracking is the process of recording what exactly users are looking at and how their gaze travels across a web page Analysing means taking all of this existing data and transforming it into accurate objective and useful insights Eye tracking tests are useful for discovering if the user understands and can follow the basic flow of the web page as well as to determine if certain elements For example your user observation study found that users tended to click on are where users expect them to be These can be conducted with webcams or contact us when looking for the opening times of a restaurant It s up to the specialised software that tracks a user s gaze or a mouse cursor researcher to analyse this were the users confused by something Was there no other obvious place to click Were they expecting to find this information easily Surveys but found themselves struggling and making a best guess Discovering the reason NOTE Surveys are questionnaires usually distributed remotely via the website that can then lead to possible solutions possibly the opening hours should be placed ask users for their impressions of the site in question Surveys are excellent for SurveyMonkey on the home page or in the header or perhaps they should simply be added to the canvassing opinions of your website after it has gone live is a free easy to use contact us page It s these practical outcomes that are the cornerstones of UX tool for creating your testing Surveys can help to answer the why questions that arise from quantitative data own web based surveys such as web analytics For example you may find that users are abandoning a Report specific page on your website even though it has interesting content The survey may reveal that they find the layout confusing or simply aren t as interested as Reporting is the process of sharing your UX test results with the people who you thought they d be need them Reports provide insights information and recommendations by summarising the results of the testing phase and the UX practitioner s analysis of what happened Ideally the whole team should be involved in analysing the test Find subjects data to encourage them to buy in to the UX process Reporting can take various forms from verbal discussions to professionally Possibly the biggest challenge in the testing process is that of finding the right test designed presentations The most important consideration here is your audience subjects So how do you do this and their needs First of all draw up a list of criteria that you want your subjects to fulfil must they Implement be men or women of a certain age in a certain industry with or without children The considerations can be endless so limit yourself to the top three or not more Implementing means putting your user testing outcomes into practice This will than five most important ones of course mean very different things at different stages of the project If you re testing your overall approach in the beginning planning phase the implementation Now spread the word about the test through the most appropriate channels to this could involve taking a new direction on the project Testing a working high fidelity group This can involve everything from advertising in a glossy magazine to posting prototype may reveal that some design elements need to change on a Facebook page to chatting to some friends or neighbours You can also pay a market research recruitment agency to find suitable candidates The method you User Experience Design Step by step guide to UX design User Experience Design Case Study Rail Europe Start again Case study Rail Europe We ve said it before and

Rail Europe is a company that sells European rail tickets to American customers helping them plan and book their railway arrangements before they travel UX tools range from rudimentary pen and paper to highly sophisticated web applications and tech tools Here is a brief roundup of popular options In Europe the rail network is comprehensive and frequently used In the US however rail travel is uncommon and often unsatisfactory so American customers are either unfamiliar with it sparking Balsamiq bills itself as a rapid wire framing tool and is uncertainty or have likely had a negative experience meaning they would be hesitant to try again great for creating fun low fidelity wireframes and simple prototypes It works both as a web app and a desktop download and has built in features for collaborating The challenge was to create an experience that would resonate with US customers provide them with other team members with accurate and useful information and give them the confidence

dictated by the CI but tones and shades will be selected by the designer Contrast is very important when displaying text online If the text and background are the same colour and there is no contrast

be cheaper to develop in an Front end languages open source front end language such as HTML but as HTML is needed to host all web pages combinations of the two are sometimes used In most cases and for the languages we cover however this is not a major NOTE Web users have come to expect rich interactive experiences online and interactive consideration website interfaces are a part of that Front end languages or client side There are many free resources online that languages are languages that are interpreted and executed in the user s browser There are several options to choose from when it comes to front end languages teach you how to code rather than on the web server although the most popular by far are HTML coupled with CSS and JavaScript One is Codecademy These experiences range from simple animations through to highly responsive HTML interfaces that require input from the user There are several technologies available to create such experiences each with its own opportunities and challenges HTML is the language for creating websites and HTML is the fifth iteration of the language It is also the name for a range of technologies that enable modern web As with server side languages you need to consider a few properties of the front browsing features It s a specification published by the web standards body W C end language you want to use Bear in mind that server side languages and front describing what features are available and how to use them HTML is different end languages are often used together as all web projects require front end from proprietary web software such as Adobe Flash in that the specification is languages for development the result of contributions from many organisations and can be implemented by anyone without having to pay for royalties or licensing fees You do however pay Cost Front end language development costs are relatively low for the development tools provided by the companies Features HTML CSS and JavaScript are open source languages often used together and are compatible with most hardware and software Content developed in these is also more search engine friendly Flash is known for its video animation and interactive multimedia capabilities In many cases similar results can be achieved with HTML CSS and JavaScript Flash can be used alone or in conjunction with other languages What your end users will be able to view should always be the most important consideration Scalability Depending on the capabilities of the device executing the language certain features may not be available or certain code may run too slowly to create a good user experience The front end code needs to take all the considered devices into account Figure The HTML logo HTML simplifies many common tasks when building a web

something that used to require the use of Flash or Silverlight Developing for the mobile phone requires an understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by mobile technology Challenges include the obvious The goal is a website that just works without the need for particular browsers or such as a smaller screen and navigation limitations as well as more complex plug ins to enable certain functionality To this end having a standardised way of issues such as file formats implementing common features means that the web is open and accessible to all regardless of competency Which

Development and Design Case study The Boston Globe The problem The process Designing with mobile in mind first is a well supported school of thought but this team designed The Boston Globe is an American daily newspaper and needed a website that would be viewable with the desktop in mind first at least for the design phase They found it easier to design this way and usable on a range of devices They turned to Upstatement editorial designers who specialise since most content fits in the desktop version The design was then simplified for smaller screens in websites and applications to assist them in solving this problem Bottitta In the coding stage the mobile first approach was used They found this worked well and used it in their subsequent projects Bottitta The solution Designing for desktop is the most complex since most elements are included but it is also easier to design for since the elements are all likely to fit in Different breakpoints were looked at Upstatement decided to build a responsive site for Boston Globe to cater to all the devices on throughout the design process with the mobile breakpoints providing the greatest insight Given which their target market would be viewing the site the limited screen size provided by mobile phones tough decisions had to be made about which elements were the most important to display Simplicity was a key theme in this design process Before this website could be built there were some key decisions that needed to be made Among with the question constantly asked being what s absolutely necessary and how I can simplify a few other considerations the project leaders needed to establish the various breakpoints Bottitta Breakpoints are the points at which the device screen is too narrow or wide to display the site optimally Once identified the elements that needed to change at each of these breakpoints could be accounted for and a smooth user experience could be created Bottitta Which elements need to change to accommodate the next breakpoint In order to illustrate some of the decisions made in this process the design of the header element Which breakpoints and screen widths to design for of the The Boston Globe website will be discussed in more detail Above the navigation bar the Upstatement had some big questions to answer before they could start the design process Some logo search bar and weather information needed to be displayed The user s account information of these were also needed to be accessed here Another important element was My Saved List where users could bookmark site contents Bottitta What are the key breakpoints What do major templates look like at each breakpoint Designing for px What do the header and footer look like Once the design elements were determined all the header elements fitted well for this breakpoint and scaled to the larger screen size of px A large dropdown enabled each subsection to be What content appears on the home page various section fronts and article page included where top stories and subcategories could easily be found Bottitta What s the overall look and feel Bottitta In order to identify the breakpoints a variety of available devices were looked at PCs laptops tablets smartphones and dumb phones were among these Upstatement identified six breakpoints Some of these were specifically for smartphones and the iPad Bottitta The following breakpoints were selected px px px px px px Figure BostonGlobe com at a px screen size Key pages were then designed to accommodate these different widths Bottitta Web Development and Design Case study The Boston Globe Web Development and Design Case study The Boston Globe Designing for px The Today s Paper section was included in the Sections dropdown to save space and the search box became an icon which expands to an input box when the user needs it Bottitta When designing for the smaller screen size of px header elements that had previously fitted no longer did To solve this they looked at what could be excluded Home couldn t be excluded and menu items couldn t be shortened and stay meaningful Bottitta As a solution My Saved List was moved from the navigation to save space Bottitta Figure BostonGlobe com at a px screen size Designing for px With more vertical space in this view the weather logo and navigation bar all appear underneath each other Things were also simplified through code with all the menus using the same style Bottitta Figure BostonGlobe com at a px screen size Designing for px Once again fewer elements fit in at this breakpoint The large dropdown was the first element to be excluded Search however is a key element and had to remain while individual sections were slotted into a section called Sections Today s Paper

coding process Figure BostonGlobe com at a px screen size Not all screen needs and interactive states can be planned out in the design process In the coding process these gaps need to be filled in It is also faster to solve some problems in the coding stage Designing for px For this reason it s beneficial to start coding when the major design decisions have been made Bottitta This breakpoint signified the first significant design change to accommodate the mobile landscape view To accommodate all the elements in this view the weather was positioned above the logo The results This was done

According to Price and Price audiences were traditionally thought of as a vast and vaguely defined crowd Price Price Because the web provides a voice to individuals and niche groups the concept of this mass audience is disintegrating Price and Price go on to argue that the Internet has led to an audience of one Price Price What does this mean While your audience is not literally one person and if it is thank your mum for reading your copy but spend some time growing your readership it is not a vast vaguely defined crowd either Instead the web has many niche audiences who are used to being addressed as individuals When you are writing marketing material you need to identify that individual investigate what he or she wants and write as if you are speaking directly to him or her The individual that you have in mind when you are writing could also be called a persona Personas Figure A sample persona Source UXmag A persona is a profile that a writer creates to embody the characteristics of the target audience for whom he or she is writing Understanding the reader profiles of your readers is an important process and the best copy usually results from extensive time

doing better than in Paris booked with Eurostar The user clicks on that banner and checks out others they could use that to improve other banners that they offer the deals on the Eurostar website A cookie is set as the first website is an affiliate of Eurostar How long does a cookie last He doesn t book right away but after chatting to his girlfriend they decide to There are a lot of different expiry periods for cookies Cookies are not just used book the trip He goes to Google searches for Eurostar weekend in Paris and for affiliate marketing They are also used to store information so that

cookie should last This is called the cookie period This time he books the trip But which affiliate should be rewarded the When it comes to affiliate marketing it is up to the merchant to decide what the commission cookie period should be The affiliate is awarded commission only if the desired Usually the most recent referral is awarded the commission although there are action takes place within the cookie period Some merchants make the cookie last some merchants who also offer compensation to other affiliates involved in the for the session only that is if the user leaves the website comes back the same sales process In the example above the affiliate who placed the PPC advert would day and then makes the purchases no commission is rewarded The standard get the commission for this sale

another method It is therefore good to bear in mind some of the problems that can be faced with If the customer completes the action but does not do so online the affiliate will not tracking receive

insights into the following fields among others The design was reworked so that the marketing message crafted to motivate visitors to complete the process was consistently communicated The most important information was placed in the SEO what keywords are people using to search for your site and how do they behave top right position on the page where most of the visitor s attention is focused The benefits were once they find it clearly laid out on the form and the terms and conditions were placed at the bottom of the page Email when is the best time to send an email newsletter Are

more people buy from you or optimisation but it is by no means an exhaustive list to increase your basket size people buy more from you As your testing becomes more sophisticated you will hopefully be achieving both Designing tests On product pages you should be testing to see how you might encourage users to start the purchasing process Some things to test include In order to design tests successfully you need to know what you can test how you can test and what sort of time periods you are looking at for testing If it s your first Images images of different sizes or entirely different image content time doing conversion optimisation you should start with simple and quick tests could make a big difference in order to get a feel for the process before embarking on more complicated tests Call to Action Add to cart or Buy now may affect shopper behaviour Types of tests Shipping information test to see whether displaying shipping costs before actual checkout affects the volume of customers starting the checkout process as well as its effect on completing the purchase When we talk about conversion rate optimisation we are usually referring to running split tests A split test is one where we show different versions of a web Credibility information do secure shopping badges affect conversion rate page to groups of users and determine which one has performed better NOTE Product pages are also a good place to test how you might increase basket size We can run A B tests Here each version being tested is different from all the Also consider your You can test displaying complementary or similar products If you spend time others A B tests often involve just two versions being tested the original and an mobile shoppers how on Amazon you ll see that they display items that customers bought together alternative There can also be many alternatives being tested can you optimise their suggesting you should do the same experience see see Version A Version B Version A Version B Figure Amazon recommends items based on past purchases and site usage The checkout process is incredibly important to test Often an online purchase takes place over several screens or steps Instead of looking at the overall conversion rate you should be looking at the conversion rate between steps This is referred to as funnel analysis Figure A B testing explained Conversion Optimisation Designing tests Conversion Optimisation Designing tests A B tests are ideal for an initial foray into conversion optimisation as they can be Number of participants easy to set up If you are running just one alternate and the original it can also The number of participants in the test is determined by how many people actually mean that you get a quicker result see the page being tested as well as what percentage of your potential customers you want to include in your test When conducting A B testing you should only change one element at a time so that you can easily isolate which factors have an impact on your conversion rate The number of people who see the page being tested may not be the same as the number of visitors to your website You ll need to use your data analytics to We can also run multivariate tests sometimes referred to as MVTs Here a determine the number of people viewing that specific page Of course if you are number of elements on a page are tested to determine which combination gives running advertising campaigns to direct traffic to the page being tested you can the best results For example we may test alternative headlines alternative copy always spend a bit more money to increase the number of people coming to that page and alternative Call to Action buttons Two versions of three elements means that we are testing eight combinations You also want to determine what percentage of people will be involved in the test In a NOTE simple A B test if you include of your visitors in the test will see version For sites with lots of A and will see version B If you include only of your visitors of your traffic limit your test to about of visitors overall visitors will see version A and will see version B Including of your visitors will give you results more quickly However you may be concerned that your alternative version could perform worse and you don t want to compromise your performance too much Change in conversion rate While this is not something you will know upfront the percentage change in conversion rate also affects the length of a test The greater the change the more quickly a statistically significant decision can be made Number of variations The more variations you have the longer it will take to determine which combination performs the best These factors can then be used to calculate the suggested length of time for a test Figure Multivariate testing combines a variety of elements to run There are several online calculators that do this for you A good one to try is Multivariate tests can be more complicated to set up but allow you to test more this one offered by Visual Website Optimizer elements at once Multivariate tests are ideal when you have large traffic volumes ab split test duration If traffic volumes are not very high it can take a very long time to reach a statistically Estimate Test Duration Scenario Scenario Scenario Scenario significant result especially if there are many combinations

chapter also hold some valuable data Gather data Analyse The very first step is to gather data about the site you are testing so that you can make smart decisions about what to test and how There are many sources that Having gathered data you need to analyse it intelligently so that you can start can be used depending on the nature of the site that you are testing Of course designing tests you also need to know the business for which you are testing what do you want website visitors to do There are some key questions that you need to answer at this stage NOTE Analytics data existing web analytics data can be used to determine What should people be doing on the site which pages in your site should be tested You can also gather data Read more about this in the Data Analytics about particular pages on your site using tools such as Crazy Egg This is where you look at the actual conversion Usually this is an action taken by a chapter or ClickTale user that increases revenue for a business There are obvious conversions to look at placing an order or completing a lead generation form for example However it User data user labs or simple site surveys is can also be useful to understand less obvious conversions or micro conversions a useful tool for these can also be used to add qualitative data to the quantitative data gathered using web analytics tools You could run a

particular information on your website Fix anything that s broken As part of your analysis you may have identified problems that can be fixed without testing Before you carry on fix these You should also try to understand if there is traffic coming to your site that is not relevant and try to segment that traffic from your calculations For example if you have a beautifully designed website that sells custom couches but is featured in a website design gallery you may get a lot of traffic that is coming only to look at your site and not to buy couches Design tests By now you should know what areas of your site need testing so it s time to design tests Establish the starting point called the null hypothesis the alternatives and the Figure Visitor flows in Google Analytics expected outcome
